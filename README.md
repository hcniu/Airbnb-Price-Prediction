# Airbnb-Price-Prediction
In this project, I try to predict the price of various Airbnbs, using text feature, categorical features, and numeric features about the listings. To be more specific, the text feature is the name and decription of the Airbnb. On the other hand, the categorical features include features, such as city of the listing and country of the listing. The numeric features include features, such as service fee.
